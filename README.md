libswiftnav
===========

[![Build status][1]][2]

Libswiftnav is a platform independent library that implements GNSS functions
and algorithms for use by software-defined GNSS receivers or software requiring
GNNS functionality.  It does not provide any functionality for communicating with
Swift Navigation receivers. See https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp to communicate
with Swift Navigation Receivers.

It is intended to be as portable as possible and is written in standards
compliant C with no dependancies other than the standard C libraries.
